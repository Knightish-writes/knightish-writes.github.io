# About Me

I'm a gamer from the Pacific Northwest who has always wanted to discuss video games online. You might be here from bluesky or my YouTube channel.

Here, I plan on talking about TTRPGs, video games, and write some fiction on occasion! Since this blog is personal, you should expect a variety of content going into it. If you find yourself enjoying the content, please share! It'd really help me grow. Currently, I do not have a Patreon, but if you'd like to support me I do have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/knightish). Support me there if you'd like.
